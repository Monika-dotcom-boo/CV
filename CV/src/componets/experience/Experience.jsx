            During the internship and then as a Junior Frontend Developer writing in React,
            {' '}
            <br />
            I learned, among others: close cooperation between all departments working on the project.  
            {' '}
            <br />
            As the only person responsible for the front end of the web application, 
            {' '}
            <br />
            I had the opportunity to learn discipline in the full sense of the word.
